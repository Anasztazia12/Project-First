    The world record for the biggest carp ever caught is held by British angler Colin Smith. 
    In 2016, he caught a massive common carp weighing 105lb 13oz (48.05 kg)
    at Euro Aqua, a fishing lake in Hungary — something I’m proud of as a Hungarian.

    Carp are freshwater fish commonly found in lakes, rivers, and slow-moving waters.
    They are widespread across Europe and are popular among anglers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Carp are omnivorous and feed on plants, insects, larvae, and small crustaceans.
    Their diverse diet makes them adaptable to different environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Common carp baits include boilies, sweetcorn, pellets, and bread.
    The choice of bait often depends on the season and water temperature.
